This project entails my first computer build - a "ML Box". As the name implies, the purpose behind the computer was to provide a platfrom where Machine Learning applications could be run quickly, removing the reliance on cloud platforms like Google Collab.

Being my first computer build, I was a bit overwhelemed by the amount of options for the various componenets and I was worried I would select parts that are incompatible with one another, or would impact the performence of the build. Luckily, there are a lot of resources availbe online, and as you do you research, you will find the whole process is really not that difficult.

Here are some resources I used to make the whole process much, much easier:
- Part Selection: [PCPartpicker](https://pcpartpicker.com/) - This free tool was a life-saver. Not only does it allow you to filter parts buy pricing (from many vendors) it also has a built in compatibility check. For example, if you select a an ATX motherboard, and a iTX case, you will get a message saying that there might be a issue with sizing. Or if you slect a 5000-series Ryzen CPU and X570 motherboard, you'll get a message saying you might need to update the BIOS before using the CPU. This is the go-to tool for many experienced PC builders, its free, and offers great features - so there is no reason not to use it.

After watching those build guides and picking my parts on PPP, I was actually fairly confident that I could do it relitvly issue-free.

We can start by first listing out the specs for the build:
